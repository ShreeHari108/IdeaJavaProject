The sensitivity of the ResultSet object is determined by one of three different ResultSet types:

·  TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY — the result set is not scrollable i.e. the cursor moves only forward, from before the first row
    to after the last row.

·  TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE — the result set is scrollable; its cursor can move both forward and backward relative to
    the current position,
and it can move to an absolute position.

·  TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE — the result set is scrollable; its cursor can move both forward and backward relative to the
    current position, and it can move to an absolute position.
==================

    Result Set Methods

    When a ResultSet object is first created, the cursor is positioned before the first row. To move the cursor, you can
    use the following methods:

    ·  next() – moves the cursor forward one row. Returns true if the cursor is now positioned on a row and false if the
    cursor is positioned after the last row.

    ·  previous() – moves the cursor backwards one row. Returns true if the cursor is now positioned on a row and false
    if the cursor is positioned before the first row.

    ·  first() – moves the cursor to the first row in the ResultSet object. Returns true if the cursor is now positioned
    on the first row and false if the ResultSet object
    does not contain any rows.

    ·  last() – moves the cursor to the last row in the ResultSet object. Returns true if the cursor is now positioned on
    the last row and false if the ResultSet object
    does not contain any rows.

    ·  beforeFirst() – positions the cursor at the start of the ResultSet object, before the first row. If the ResultSet
    object does not contain any rows, this method has
    no effect.

    ·  afterLast() – positions the cursor at the end of the ResultSet object, after the last row. If the ResultSet object
    does not contain any rows, this method has no effect.

    ·  relative(int rows) – moves the cursor relative to its current position.

    ·  absolute(int n) – positions the cursor on the n-th row of the ResultSet object.
